I recently graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Engineering Physics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I plan to attend UIUC in the fall for a PhD in Computer Science. Generally, I am interested in machine learning, theory, and optimization. 

This summer I am interning at [SumUp Analytics](http://sumupanalytics.com/).
